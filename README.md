## Overview

Patch Manager Plus provides the ability to retrieve custom information from its database using Query Reports. This is particularly useful when standard reports don't provide the specific data required for compliance, auditing, or operational needs. Query Reports can be created through the Reports tab → Custom Report → New Query Report functionality.

## Features

- **Extended PPM Reports**: Comprehensive patch management reports with customer information, system details, patch status, and health metrics
- **Short PPM Reports**: Condensed reports focusing on essential patch information
- **Branch Office Details**: Reports for managing distributed environments and branch office configurations
- **Managed Devices Details**: Detailed device inventory and management status reports

## Available Reports

### Core Reports (queries/)

1. **Short PPM Report** (`short_pmp_report.sql`) ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
   - Condensed patch information for quick assessments
   - Essential customer identification and basic system info
   - Fast execution suitable for large environments
   - Ideal for executive summaries and mobile reports
   - **Production-ready and PM+ verified**

2. **Branch Office Reports** 
   - **Simple Count** (`branch_office_simple.sql`): Quick computer count per branch
   - **Detailed** (`branch_office_detailed.sql`): Comprehensive branch management with replication policies

### Example Reports (queries/examples/) ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL

These queries may not work reliably in all PM+ environments. Test thoroughly before use.

3. **Extended PPM Report** (`examples/extended_pmp_report.sql`) ⚠️
   - Comprehensive patch management with detailed system information
   - Complex CASE statements may cause compatibility issues
   - Use `short_pmp_report.sql` for production instead

4. **Managed Devices Details** (`examples/managed_devices_details.sql`) ⚠️
   - Complete device inventory and management status
   - Large result sets may cause performance issues
   - Test in development environment first

5. **Security Vulnerability Report** (`examples/security_vulnerability_report.sql`)
   - Security-focused analysis with critical patch identification
   - Vulnerability assessment and compliance auditing

6. **Patch Compliance Summary** (`examples/patch_compliance_summary.sql`)
